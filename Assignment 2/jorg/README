Question 1.1:
=============================
gaussian.m

additional helper function to compare fspecial shapes:
comp_fspecials.m

Question 1.2:
=============================
gaussianConv.m

we made a separate function called gaussianConv2d that convolves with a 2D filter once:
gaussianConv2d.m

this function plots a surface with the absolute differences of the two methods
plot_diff_1D_2D_conv.m

Question 1.3:
============================
gaussianDer.m

This script plots the Gaussian first order derivative
plot_gauss_der.m

This functions plots the "zebra-edges" for different sizes of sigma
plot_zebra_edges.m
