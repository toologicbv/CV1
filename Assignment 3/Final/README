For section 1:
=============================
HarrisCornerDetectorv2.m

A demo function that returns the H matrix, the rows of the detected corner points r, and the columns of those points c there is 
also a input parameter plot_yn. If plot_yn = true the function also plots three figures,  derivatives Ix and Iy, and the original image.

For section 3:
=============================
LucasKanadeAlgorithm.m

A demo function which runs [X , Y, u,v]. X and Y are the coordinates vectors of the velocity vectors u and v in the images. U and V
are the velocity vecots that describes the horizontal and vertical motion of every window in the image. 

This function has a input parameter plot_results. If plot_results= true the first input images will be plotted with the velocity vectors calculated by yhe algoritme

For section 4:
============================
createOpticalFlow.m

This function calculates the optical flow for a sample image sequences. With this optical flow we can track corner points in a sample image sequences.
