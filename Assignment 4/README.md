(1) keypointMatches.m

A demo functions that finds keypoint matchings between two input images based on Loewe SIFT
implementation of Andrea Vidaldi

(2) plotMatchingPoints.m

Plots a random subset of the matching points between image 1 and 2 on the concatenated image and connects
them with lines

(3) RANSACv2.m

A demo function that uses RANSAC algorithm to find best transformation parameters. Also returns the best set
of matching points belonging to the t-parameters.
